## ðŸ“š Notebooks Overview

### 1. Intro_to_NLP.ipynb
This notebook provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers:
* **What is NLP?** - Definition, intersection with computer science, AI, and linguistics, and challenges of human language (ambiguity, context, sarcasm/irony).
* **Strings** - Fundamental concepts of strings in Python, including creation using single, double, and triple quotes.
* **String Indexing and Slicing** - How to access parts of a string using indexing (starting at 0) and slicing (`[start:end]`).
* **String Methods** - Important built-in string functions like `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, and `.join()` for text cleaning and manipulation.
* **F-Strings** - A simple and readable way to embed expressions within string literals.
* **Journey to NLP (NLTK)** - Introduction to NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) as a foundational library for language processing.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Example** - Demonstrates loading and basic exploration of a Kaggle dataset (`tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv`) using Pandas, including checking for null values and adding a review length column. It also visualizes the distribution of review lengths using a histogram and generates a WordCloud.

### 2. Learning_Python_In2Stem_Placement.ipynb
This notebook offers an interactive guide to learning Python basics, covering:
* **First Program** - A classic "Hello World!" example.
* **Different Types of Comments** - Explains single-line (`#`), multi-line (using multiple `#` or triple quotes), and in-line comments.
* **Arithmetic Operations** - Covers basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (including quotient `//` and remainder `%`), and exponentiation (`**`), emphasizing the PEDMAS rule. Includes an interactive widget to experiment with arithmetic.
* **Boolean Operations** - Demonstrates comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). Features an interactive widget for boolean operations.
* **Importing Libraries** - How to import modules (`import math as m`, `from math import tau`) and use `help()` and `keyword.kwlist`.
* **type()** - Explains how to use `type()` to determine the data type of various objects (int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, dict).
* **Data Types and Structures** - Overview of Python's built-in data structures (List, dictionary, tuple, set), differentiating between mutable and immutable types.
    * **Strings**: Creation, comparison, length (`len()`), `in` operator, indexing, slicing, escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`), multi-line strings using triple quotes, multiplication, concatenation, and various string functions (`.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.capitalize()`, `.title()`, `.replace()`, `.count()`, `.split()`, `.find()`, `.index()`, `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`, `.lstrip()`, `.rstrip()`, `.strip()`, `.swapcase()`, `.isalnum()`, `.isnumeric()`, `.isalpha()`, `.islower()`, `.isupper()`, `.istitle()`, `.isspace()`).
    * **Lists**: Creation, concatenation, multiplication, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `append()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `insert()`, accessing elements by index (including nested lists and slicing), `count()`, `index()`, `remove()`, `reverse()`, and `sort()`. Includes an interactive widget for list manipulation.
    * **Tuples**: Similar to lists but immutable, defined using `()`, and functions like `count()`, `index()`, `sum()`, `len()`, `sorted()`, `reversed()`, and tuple unpacking. Includes an interactive widget to access tuple elements.
    * **Dictionaries**: Defined by key-value pairs `{}`, mutable, unique and immutable keys, adding/updating pairs, accessing `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()`, and converting from tuples. Includes an interactive widget for dictionary manipulation.
    * **Sets**: Contains unique elements, adding (`.add()`), removing (`.remove()`, `.discard()`), copying (`.copy()`), and clearing (`.clear()`) elements, and converting between lists and sets. Demonstrates set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
* **isinstance()** - Checks the type of an object.
* **Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)** - How to convert between data types using constructors like `int()`, `str()`, `float()`, `bool()`, `list()`, and `tuple()`.
* **Advanced Numbers** - Covers octal (`0o`), hexadecimal (`0x`), binary (`0b`), and complex numbers.
* **Input at Runtime** - Using the `input()` function to get user input and converting it to different data types.
* **Conditional Statements** - `if-else` and `elif` statements, emphasizing indentation.
* **range()** - Generates sequences of numbers.
* **For Loop** - Iterating over lists and using list, dictionary, and set comprehensions.
* **enumerate()** - Yields (index, value) tuples during iteration.
* **While Loop** - Basic `while` loop usage and a data cleaning example.
* **Break and Continue Statements** - Controls loop execution flow.
* **Creating Functions using `def`** - Function definition, parameters, return statements, and documentation. Includes examples like data cleaning and list summation within functions, and histogram creation using dictionaries.
* **Lambda Statement** - Creating small anonymous functions.
* **join()** - Joins a list of strings.
* **Error Handling (try-except-finally)** - Managing runtime errors.
* **Iterator** - Using `iter()` and `next()` for iterable objects.
* **Generators** - Lazily evaluated iterators using `yield`.
* **Decorator** - Modifying function behavior with decorators, including multiple decorators and memoization.
* **Objects and Classes** - Concepts of classes, objects, attributes, methods, `self`, `__init__`, and `dir()`.
    * **Encapsulation**: Protected (`_`) and private (`__`) members, and name mangling.
    * **Special Methods**: `__init__` and `__str__`.
* **Inheritance** - Creating subclasses and understanding Method Resolution Order (MRO).
* **Python Challenges**: Includes several coding challenges to apply learned concepts, such as a guessing game, grade calculator, even/odd checker, leap year checker, and a password validator (partially implemented).
